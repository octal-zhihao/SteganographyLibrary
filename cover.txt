Once upon a time, in a valley where the clouds brushed the mountaintops like feathers, there lived a little rabbit named Nilo. Nilo was not like the other rabbits—while they were content with carrots and clover, Nilo dreamed of touching the stars.

Each night, as the other rabbits huddled in their burrows and drifted off to sleep, Nilo would lie on his back beneath the silver moonlight, staring up at the sky. The stars twinkled like diamonds on velvet, and to Nilo, they seemed to whisper secrets meant only for him. He would imagine himself leaping from hilltop to hilltop, soaring higher with each jump until, at last, he could pluck a star from the sky and hold it in his tiny paws.

The other rabbits often chuckled at Nilo’s dreams. “You’re just a rabbit,” they would say. “Rabbits don’t belong in the sky. We dig, we nibble, we hop. That’s what we do.” But Nilo would only smile and look back toward the mountains, where the peaks seemed to pierce the heavens.
